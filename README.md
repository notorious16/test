# test
This is my second test project. You can see it working on http://test42.zzz.com.ua/ . 
Basically, it is site with some personages from Star-Wars. I used AJAX requests to get some information from https://swapi.co/ and
use it in the project. I did a little animation there, put some pictures and did a checkboxes which save it's result in your cookies. 
So, if page is reloaded the result of checkboxes stays the same. That's it!
The site was done without frameworks. Only using HTML, CSS and JS(jQuery). No back-end side there(dark side). :)
